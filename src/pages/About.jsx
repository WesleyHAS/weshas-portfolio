              Hey there! I'm Wes, a Full Stack Junior Developer. My original
              career was as a professional Chef, but due to a wrist injury, I
              was forced to hang up my apron and explore new opportunities. This
              experience rekindled my passion and curiosity for the tech field.
              I thrive in high-pressure environments and enjoy problem-solving.
              I graduated from the University of Toronto's School of Continuing
              Studies Coding Bootcamp in 2024, acquiring a range of skills along
              the way, including HTML/CSS + Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6 + JQuery,
              MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js (MERN stack), SQL + NoSQL,
              GitHub, MVC, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and
              Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In a previous life, I wore the hat of an Executive Chef of a 300
              seat italian restaurant. Cooking isn't just a skill; it's a
              creative expression that taught me the art of multitasking,
              urgency, and maintaining a sense of calm under pressure. My
              journey in the culinary world has contributed to my
              problem-solving abilities and instilled a strong sense of
              discipline.
